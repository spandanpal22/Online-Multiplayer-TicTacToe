<br/>
<h2>How to play?</h2>
<b>1. </b>Create your profile on the site and sign up. <br/><br/>
<b>2. </b>Now open the play section where you can either create a game room for your friend and yourself or join an already created room by your friend.
<br/><br/>
<b>NOTE - </b> Choose such a room name which is not already taken and share it only with that friend of yours whom you want to play the game with. A room can have only 2 players. Only players having permission to join a particular room can join the room.<br/><br/>
<b>3. </b>After entering the room players can start the game and also chat with each other at the same time. No chat is stored so once you refresh the page the chats will be gone. Each match will have 5 games.<br/><br/>

<h2>About this application</h2>
This application is built using django. It uses websockets for real time communication which is implemented using django-channels. In the front-end part, this application is responsive and uses Bootstrap for that. I have also implemented the sign up and login features here. Users can also view their profiles. 
<br/><br/>I have hosted this application on heroku but as I am using free tier of heroku. So, while playing it there you might not get the best performance of the site.
