<h2>About this application</h2>
This application is built using django. It uses websockets for real time communication which is implemented using django-channels. In the front-end part, this application is responsive and uses Bootstrap for that. This is an ASGI application(Not WSGI).
<br/><br/>I have hosted this application on Heroku but as I am using free tier of Heroku. So, while playing it there you might not get the best performance of this application. To play the game on my hosted application on Heroku <a href="https://online-multiplayer-tic-tac-toe.herokuapp.com/">CLICK HERE</a>. Though I would suggest you to run this on your PC if you really want to test it as Heroku free tier has a lot of limits.
